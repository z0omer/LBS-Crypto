**ABOUT THE EVENT**

‚ÄúInto the Hyperverse" is a session for individuals interested in a Web 3.0 career presented by Nik Kalyani and Samina Kabir of Decentology, a Silicon Valley-based crypto company.

In this session, Kalyani and Kabir will start by introducing you to crypto fundamentals of web architecture, blockchain, cryptography, smart contracts, and decentralized applications ("dapps").

Next, you'll get a glimpse into the future of composable dapps by journeying into the Hyperverse, an open marketplace for "smart modules," which are like Lego blocks for building dapps.

Finally, Kalyani and Kabir will round it out by building a simple dapp LIVE, that'll give you deep insights into how dapps work and what skills you'll need to build for the Hyperverse.

Join us in this exciting session bringing nothing other than a great attitude, and a desire to immerse yourself into the exciting new world of crypto. You'll leave invigorated with all the knowledge you need to venture into the Hyperverse ‚ú®

_Please note: this event is open to the LBS community only. We thank you, in advance, for your understanding. Additionally, all LBS students are encouraged to apply; however, priority will be given to those with prior coding experience and/ or background in math and computer science._
