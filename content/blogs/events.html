<p><strong>ABOUT THE EVENT</strong></p>
<p>“Into the Hyperverse” is a session for individuals interested in a Web 3.0 career presented by Nik Kalyani and Samina Kabir of Decentology, a Silicon Valley-based crypto company.</p>
<p>In this session, Kalyani and Kabir will start by introducing you to crypto fundamentals of web architecture, blockchain, cryptography, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (“dapps”).</p>
<p>Next, you’ll get a glimpse into the future of composable dapps by journeying into the Hyperverse, an open marketplace for “smart modules,” which are like Lego blocks for building dapps.</p>
<p>Finally, Kalyani and Kabir will round it out by building a simple dapp LIVE, that’ll give you deep insights into how dapps work and what skills you’ll need to build for the Hyperverse.</p>
<p>Join us in this exciting session bringing nothing other than a great attitude, and a desire to immerse yourself into the exciting new world of crypto. You’ll leave invigorated with all the knowledge you need to venture into the Hyperverse ✨</p>
<p><em>Please note: this event is open to the LBS community only. We thank you, in advance, for your understanding. Additionally, all LBS students are encouraged to apply; however, priority will be given to those with prior coding experience and/ or background in math and computer science.</em></p>
